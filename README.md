# web-crawler

## To understand network topology of any given site
* This is based on BFS algorithm
* Vertex are replaced by website-name
* Run App.java to see how it works

## What are we trying to solve through this application? 
1. What are the most frequently visited websites for a given website?

## Note
* If the application fails to print out any URLs, check the input URL that is fed in the first place
* Please note that some servers deny access to read from URL class method
* So an exception is thrown occasionally, but nevertheless the application will not stop working
